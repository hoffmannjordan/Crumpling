# POV-Ray will generate an error if it encounters a "degenerate cylinder" where
# the two end points are equal. This code will scan the POV-Ray files created
# by Voro++, and strip out any of these cases.
#
# Usually, the degenerate cylinders generated by Voro++ are not actually
# degenerate in its internal representation (since the code is specifically
# structured to avoid cases like that). However, these cases are caused by the
# POV-Ray files which are generate only have coordinates specified to a limited
# number of decimal places. In a future version, it would be nice for Voro++ to
# automatically recognize and ignore these cases.
